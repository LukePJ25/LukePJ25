Hi, I'm Luke ðŸ‘‹. I'm a student at Prifysgol Aberystwyth University.

I'm currently looking to expand on my understanding and experiences within the area of software development. Right now I'm working on learning about full-stack web-development with technologies like PHP, React, and Node.js. I also have experience with more simple/common languages like Java, Python, and more typical front-end web languages.

Please feel free to check out some of my projects below, or take a look at my website to learn more!
